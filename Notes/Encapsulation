- What is Encapsulation in Ruby? (3 sentences)
    Encapsulation is the practice of creating boundaries to contain the internal behaviour of the object. Good encapsulation prevents the internal behaviour (e.g. data) from being directly influenced by other objects, and in the long term, this reduces complexity and interdependence, and increases the modularity of your program. In the ideal situation, good encapsulation prevents internal changes to one class from breaking the interactions another class has with it.
- Give an example of a poorly-encapsulated class that uses an attr_accessor. 
    ```ruby
    class VideogameCar
  attr_accessor :mass, :engine_size, :method_for_acceleration, :hash_of_mass, :hash_of_engines

  def initialize(model)
    @car_make = model
    @hash_of_mass = {:model1 = mass1, :model2 = mass2...}
    @hash_of_engines = {:model1 = engine_size1, :model2 = engine_size2...}
    @mass = predefined_mass_hash[@car_make]
    @engine_size = predefined_engine_hash[@car_make]
  end

  def drive(player_input)
    @acceleration = method_for_acceleration(player_input, @engine_size , @mass)
  end

  def method_for_acceleration
    #boring complex code, with blocks calling blocks inside of procs to send define methods into classes
  end

end


class Player
  
  def drive(car)
    car.drive(player_input)
  end

end
```
    
    
- Explain why it is a poor example of Encapsulation
- Refactor the class to better use Encapsulation.
